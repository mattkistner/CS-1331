Extra Credit:
- I utilized a Check Box and the Background class to create a Dark Mode that switches
to dark mode and back dependent upon if the box is selected. 
- I also utilized the javafx.animation classes to create a "winning animation" that enlarges
the scale of each rectangle (ScaleTransition) within a row if the word is correctly guessed within the row.
